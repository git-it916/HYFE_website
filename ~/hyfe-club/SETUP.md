Okay, I understand. You've provided the start of the setup guide and then a complete React component (`App.js`) that uses Tailwind CSS. The goal is to integrate the missing Tailwind CSS setup steps into the guide, and then include the provided React component as an example of the application's code that leverages Tailwind.

Here's the updated HYFE Club Setup Guide, incorporating the Tailwind CSS initialization and configuration steps, followed by your `App.js` code as an example.
